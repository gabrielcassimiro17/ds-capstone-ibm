The case I will be looking in this analysis is one of a study to open a bakery in Manhattan, NY. The study consists in numerous stages. I will participate in the location stage, in which we will study the best neighborhood to open the bakery.

Data:

For this problem I will use the Foursquare location and the data of Manhattan neighborhoods.

Methodology:

The methodology used for this analysis consisted in a exploratory analysis and a clustering using k Ð means.

We are using clustering to understand the similarity between neighborhoods choosing one with the minimal competitors but similar to other neighborhoods in the same cluster.

Results:

In the analysis we found that the best possible neighborhoods for opening a bakery in Manhattan are Clinton, Murray Hill, East Village, Lower East Side, Financial District, Midtown South and Flatiron.

Discussion:

In the analysis we found the most common venues in all the neighborhoods. This analysis helps a lot to find the competitors.

Conclusion:

In the analysis we found that the best possible neighborhoods after separating them into clusters. They mean that the interests of consumers are similar in the clusters so we should open a bakery in a cluster of the neighborhoods that have the most bakeries. 

We found that the options are Manhattan are Clinton, Murray Hill, East Village, Lower East Side, Financial District, Midtown South and Flatiron.

The choice will depend on more analysis of other factors, but we were able to reduce significantly the number of options.
